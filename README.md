# Welcome TurnoverBNB!!

I just loved to create this app, was an opportunity to create something with a lot of new things tools and architecture!

Just one thing to add, I have started the development with MirageJS and I have finished with that, this is an API mocking library, everything about it it's raw at App.js, it's really good, but the test of the interation between user and adm needs to be done in the app without reload of the entire app, because he just maintain the data at the that of you are running the app!

Currently includes:

- React Native
- React Navigation
- MobX State Tree controlling the api states
- RecoilJS to control the share state on the app
- i18n for internationalization, english and brazilian portuguese, I did not finish the portuguese translation because of the time! :(
- Storybook, but sorry that I couldnt create for all components!
- Reactotron for inspecting the app state
- APISauce for REST
- MirageJS for mocking the API
- TypeScript of course

## Quick Start

Just run yarn start and select your simulator and you are good to go!
